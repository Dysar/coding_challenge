ok
1. Only whole packs can be sent. Packs cannot be broken open.
2. Within the constraints of Rule 1 above, send out no more items than necessary to fulfil the order.
3. Within the constraints above, send out Rules 1 & 2 send out as few packs as possible to fulfil each order.

1>2>3

so, for instance, they need to be able to write the algorithm that takes into the account changing in values

When sharing this info with the Developer, make sure they understand that Rule 1 must be enforced before Rule 2, before Rule 3

So, if you change the value of the Pack sizes, the algorithm should be able to account for that change in value to send out as few packs as necessary

So, if we change the Pack Size values to So, if
23
31
53

And we are calculating for 500,000 in Quantity

The result should be a combination of the pack sizes and should read something like
{23:2, 31:7, 53:9429}

so, 2 packs of 23, 7 packs of 31 and
9,429 packs of 53

I hope that makes sense
